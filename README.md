This is a Next.js & Netlify Identity tutorial by the Net Ninja YouTube channel. Check out the [full tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i4g-0dAaMmFAyM6k3FmuZz).

### Notes
There have been a few updates to Netlify since this tutorial came out. It looks like the login/setup doesn't connect when using the development server.

I needed to enable Identity in the settings of Netlify (then disable the email confirmation as mentioned in Net Ninja's tutorial).

Will add more here as I find out other problems.
