This is a completed Next.js & Netlify Identity tutorial project by the Net Ninja YouTube channel. Check out the [full tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i4g-0dAaMmFAyM6k3FmuZz).

Here is a link to my deployed site: https://net-ninja-next-netlify-arensman.netlify.app/

### Notes
There have been a few updates to Netlify since this tutorial came out. It looks like the login/setup doesn't connect when using your own development server - you have to install the Netlify CLI and use that dev server for it to work.

I needed to enable Identity in the settings of Netlify (then disable the email confirmation as mentioned in Net Ninja's tutorial).
